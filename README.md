Transfer Credit Equivalency System


Description of the Problem
   In student transfers between universities, it is expected that the student will be exempt from the courses successfully completed at the previous university. Since this process is done by examining the course contents one by one by the related faculty lecturers, it is a long and laborious process.

Definition and Function of the Project
   Automating the finding of equivalent courses by comparing the course contents of the student's old school and the new school to be used in transitions between universities.

Tools and Languages
   The project was developed using the python v3.4 programming language. VS Code and PyCharm development environments were used in the project development.

What innovations were introduced?
    Instead of the traditional method, where universities can learn course equivalence by taking course content from the previous school and submitting it to the student affairs of the transferred university, thanks to this project, course equivalence is checked more quickly.
